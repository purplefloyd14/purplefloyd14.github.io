						<description>Rutherford v. United States | 11/12/25 | Docket #: 24-820

24-820 RUTHERFORD V. UNITED STATES
DECISION BELOW: 120 F.4th 360
CONSOLIDATED FOR ONE HOUR ORAL ARGUMENT WITH 24-860
CERT. GRANTED 6/6/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
The compassionate-release statute permits courts to reduce a prisoner's 
sentence if the court finds that "extraordinary and compelling reasons" warrant relief. 18 
U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). Congress placed only two limits on what can count as an 
"extraordinary and compelling reason": (1) it must be "consistent with" "applicable policy 
statements" from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 
id
.; and (2) "[r]ehabilitation of the 
defendant alone shall not be considered an extra- ordinary and compelling reason," 28 
U.S.C. § 994(t).
Sections 401 and 403 of the First Step Act of 2018 reduced penalties for certain 
drug and firearm offenses going forward. Because of these changes, individuals 
sentenced today for these offenses often face mandatory minimum terms of 
imprisonment decades shorter than they would have received before the First Step Act.
The question presented is:
Whether, as four circuits permit but six others prohibit, a district court may 
consider disparities created by the First Step Act's prospective changes in sentencing 
law when deciding if "extraordinary and compelling reasons" warrant a sentence 
reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).

						<description>Fernandez v. United States | 11/12/25 | Docket #: 24-556

24-556 FERNANDEZ V. UNITED STATES
DECISION BELOW: 104 F.4th 420
THE PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI IS GRANTED LIMITED TO THE 
FOLLOWING QUESTION: WHETHER A COMBINATION OF 
“
EXTRAORDINARY AND 
COMPELLING REASONS
” 
THAT MAY WARRANT A DISCRETIONARY SENTENCE 
REDUCTION UNDER 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(1)(A) CAN INCLUDE REASONS THAT 
MAY ALSO BE ALLEGED AS GROUNDS FOR VACATUR OF A SENTENCE UNDER 
28 U. S. C. §2255.
 
CERT. GRANTED 5/27/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
Under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), a district court has broad discretion to reduce 
the term of imprisonment in any case if it finds that "extraordinary and compelling 
reasons warrant such a reduction." The sole limitation Congress placed on that 
discretion is found in 18 U.S.C. § 994(t), which provides that "[r]ehabilitation of the 
defendant alone shall not be considered an extraordinary and compelling reason." In 
reversing the district court's grant of compassionate release to Joe Fernandez, the 
Second Circuit held that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to have considered 
evidence bearing on Fernandez's potential innocence as well to have found a disparity 
in sentences between Fernandez and several of his co-defendants who were 
cooperating witnesses. That decision was contrary to decisions of the First and Ninth 
Circuits, which have each held that district courts are not restricted with respect to 
matters they may consider under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) other than as set forth by 
Congress. The question presented is:
Whether the Second Circuit erred in recognizing extra-textual limitations on what 
information a court may consider when determining whether there exist extraordinary 
and compelling reasons warranting a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)
(A).

24-758 THE GEO GROUP, INC. V. MENOCAL
DECISION BELOW: 2024 WL 4544184
CERT. GRANTED 6/2/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, the courts of appeals "have jurisdiction of appeals from all final 
decisions of the district courts." This Court has held that certain orders are immediately 
appealable under Section 1291 even though they do not terminate the litigation. Such 
"collateral orders" include orders denying claims of absolute immunity, qualified immunity, and 
state sovereign immunity.
The question presented, which has divided the circuit courts 5-3, is whether an order 
denying a government contractor's claim of derivative sovereign immunity is immediately 
appealable under the collateral-order doctrine.

23-1197 LANDOR V. LA DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS
DECISION BELOW: 82 F.4th 337
CERT. GRANTED 6/23/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
Congress has enacted two "sister" statutes to protect religious exercise: the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. 2000bb 
et seq
., and the 
Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. 
2000cc 
et seq
. In 
Tanzin v. Tanvir
, 592 U.S. 43 (2020), this Court held that an 
individual may sue a government official in his individual capacity for damages for 
violations of RFRA. RLUIPA's relevant language is identical.
The question presented is whether an individual may sue a government official in 
his individual capacity for damages for violations of RLUIPA.

CERT. GRANTED 9/9/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1701 
et seq.
 ("IEEPA") 
permits the President, upon a valid emergency declaration, to "investigate, block during the 
pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any 
acquisition, holding, withholding,
  
use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or 
exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or 
transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any 
interest[.]" 
Id.
 § l 702(a)(1)(B). Until now, no President in IEEPA's nearly 50-year history has 
ever invoked it to impose tariffs-let alone the sweeping worldwide tariffs imposed pursuant to 
the executive orders challenged here.
The question presented is:
Whether IEEPA authorizes the President to impose tariffs.

						<description>Hain Celestial Group v. Palmquist | 11/04/25 | Docket #: 24-724

24-724 HAIN CELESTIAL GROUP V. PALMQUIST
DECISION BELOW: 103 F.4th 294
CERT. GRANTED 4/28/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
Respondents, citizens of Texas, filed this products-liability suit in state court 
against Petitioners Hain Celestial Group, Inc., then a citizen of Delaware and New York, 
and Whole Foods, Inc., a citizen of Texas. Hain removed based on diversity jurisdiction, 
arguing that Whole Foods should be dismissed as fraudulently joined. The district court 
agreed, dismissing Whole Foods with prejudice. After two additional years of federal-
court litigation and a two-week jury trial, the district court granted judgment as a matter 
of law to Hain. On appeal, without ruling on the merits, the Fifth Circuit held that the 
district court erred in dismissing Whole Foods, vacated the final judgment, and ordered 
the matter remanded to state court to start from scratch. Relying on Respondents' post-
removal amended complaint, the panel held, in conflict with several other courts of 
appeals, that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter judgment as to the completely 
diverse parties before it.
The questions presented are:
1.
         
Whether a district court's final judgment as to completely diverse parties 
must be vacated when an appellate court later determines that it erred by dismissing a 
non-diverse party at the time of removal.
2.
         
Whether a plaintiff may defeat diversity jurisdiction after removal by 
amending the complaint to add factual allegations that state a colorable claim against a 
nondiverse party when the complaint at the time of removal did not state such a claim

24-808 CONEY ISLAND AUTO PARTS, INC. V. BURTON
DECISION BELOW: 109 F.4th 438
CERT. GRANTED 6/6/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
Well-settled legal principles dictate that a judgment entered in the absence of 
personal jurisdiction is void. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) authorizes federal 
courts to vacate a judgment when it is void. A motion seeking vacatur, however, "must 
be made within a reasonable time." Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).
Each of the United States Courts of Appeals other than the Sixth Circuit holds that 
there is effectively no time limit for moving to vacate a judgment, notwithstanding Rule 
60(c)(1)'s "reasonable time" requirement, when the judgment is obtained in the absence 
of personal jurisdiction. The common thinking among these circuits is that a judgment 
entered without personal jurisdiction is void ab initio.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is the sole outlier. In this 
case, it held that Rule 60(c)(1) governs the timing of a motion seeking vacatur of a void 
judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4).
The question presented is:
Whether Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(c)(1) imposes any time limit to set 
aside a void default judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction.

						<description>Hencely v. Fluor Corp. | 11/03/25 | Docket #: 24-924

24-924 HENCELY V. FLUOR CORP.
DECISION BELOW: 120 F.4th 412
CERT. GRANTED 6/2/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
Former U.S. Army Specialist Winston T. Hencely was critically and permanently injured 
by a suicide bomber inside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. The bomber, Ahmad Nayeb, worked 
on base for a government contractor. An Army investigation found that the attack's primary 
contributing factor was the contractor's actions in breach of its Army contract and in violation 
of the military's instructions to supervise Nayeb. Hencely sued the government contractor for 
negligence under South Carolina law. He did not sue the military under the Federal Tort Claims 
Act.
Even so, the Fourth Circuit held that Hencely's state claims are preempted by unspoken 
"federal interests" emanating from an FTCA exception. Invoking 
Boyle v. United Technologies 
Corp.
, 487 U.S. 500 (1988), the court of appeals held that the FTCA's exception immunizing the 
government
 for "[a]ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval 
forces ... during time of war," 28 U.S.C. §2680(j), barred Hencely's South Carolina claims against 
the 
contractor
. The decision below reaffirmed a 3-1-1 split among the Second, Third, Fourth, 
Ninth and D.C. Circuits over 
Boyle
's reach when contractors defend against state tort claims by 
invoking §2680(j).
The question presented is:
Should 
Boyle
 be extended to allow federal interests emanating from the FTCA's 
combatant-activities exception to preempt state tort claims against a government 
contractor for conduct that breached its contract and violated military orders?

						<title>Louisiana v. Callais</title>
						<description>Louisiana v. Callais | 10/15/25 | Docket #: 24-109

							Background: Louisiana was ordered by federal courts to create a second majority-Black congressional district to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The Louisiana Legislature responded by passing S.B. 8, which created the required second majority-Black district. However, a different federal court then ruled that S.B. 8 was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander and blocked its implementation.

							The Core Issue: Can a state be required to create a majority-minority district under the Voting Rights Act, but then have that same district struck down as unconstitutional racial gerrymandering? Louisiana argues this creates an impossible legal bind.

							Questions Before the Court: Whether the lower court erred in finding that race predominated in drawing S.B. 8, whether the map fails strict scrutiny review, whether certain legal tests were properly applied, and whether courts should even be deciding these redistricting disputes.

							Current Status: The case has been restored for reargument. The Court has ordered supplemental briefing on whether intentionally creating majority-minority districts violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments.

							Significance: This case could reshape how states balance Voting Rights Act compliance with constitutional requirements, potentially affecting redistricting nationwide.

24-394 OK CHARTER SCHOOL BOARD V. DRUMMOND
DECISION BELOW: 558 P.3d 1
CONSOLIDATED WITH 
24-396
 FOR ONE HOUR ORAL ARGUMENT. 
 
JUSTICE 
BARRETT TOOK NO PART. 
EXPEDITED BRIEFING. 
CERT. GRANTED 1/24/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
This Court has "repeatedly held that a State violates the Free Exercise Clause 
when it excludes religious observers from otherwise available public benefits." 
Carson 
as next friend of O. C. v. Makin
, 596 U.S. 767, 778 (2022). Three times, the Court has 
applied that principle to strike down "state efforts to withhold otherwise available public 
benefits from religious organizations."
 Id
. at 778-79 (citing 
Trinity Lutheran Church of 
Columbia, Inc. v. Comer
, 582 U.S. 449 (2017); 
Espinoza v. Mont. Dep't of Revenue
, 
591 U.S. 464 (2020)).
Contrary to those precedents, the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that a state can 
exclude privately owned and operated religious charter schools from its charter-school 
program by enforcing state-law bans on "sectarian" and religiously affiliated charter 
schools. The court also held that a charter school engages in state action for 
constitutional purposes when it contracts with the state to provide publicly funded 
education. These rulings implicate an entrenched circuit split and present two questions 
for review:
1. Whether the academic and pedagogical choices of a privately owned and run 
school constitute state action simply because it contracts with the state to offer a free 
educational option for interested students.
2. Whether a state violates the Free Exercise Clause by excluding privately run 
religious schools from the state's charter-school program solely because the schools are 
religious, or whether a state can justify such an exclusion by invoking anti-establishment 
interests that go further than the Establishment Clause requires.

24-351 UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE V. KONAN
DECISION BELOW: 96 F.4th 799
CERT. GRANTED 4/21/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), ch. 753, 60 Stat. 842 (28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 
et 
seq
.), generally waives the United States' sovereign immunity for suits seeking damages "for 
injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or 
omission" of an employee of the federal government "under circumstances where the United 
States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the 
place where the act or omission occurred." 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). The FTCA, however, excepts 
from that waiver of immunity "[a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent 
transmission of letters or postal matter." 28 U.S.C. 2680(b). The question presented is as 
follows:
Whether a plaintiff's claim that she and her tenants did not receive mail because Postal 
Service employees intentionally did not deliver it to a designated address arises out of "the 
loss" or "miscarriage" of letters or postal matter. 28 U.S.C. 2680(b).

24-568 BOST V. ILLINOIS BOARD OF ELECTIONS
DECISION BELOW: 114 F.4th 634
CERT. GRANTED 6/2/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
Federal law sets the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November as the 
federal Election Day. 2 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 7; and 3 U.S.C. § 1. Several states, including 
Illinois, have enacted state laws that allow ballots to be received and counted after 
Election Day. Petitioners contend these state laws are preempted under the Elections 
and Electors Clauses. Petitioners sued to enjoin Illinois' law allowing ballots to be 
received up to fourteen days after Election Day.
The sole question presented here is whether Petitioners, as federal candidates, 
have pleaded sufficient factual allegations to show Article III standing to challenge state 
time, place, and manner regulations concerning their federal elections.

24-539 CHILES V. SALAZAR
DECISION BELOW: 116 F.4th 1178
CERT. GRANTED 3/10/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
Kaley Chiles is a licensed counselor who helps people by talking with them. A 
practicing Christian, Chiles believes that people flourish when they live consistently with 
God's design, including their biological sex. Many of her clients seek her counsel 
precisely
 because
 they believe that their faith and their relationship with God 
establishes the foundation upon which to understand their identity and desires. But 
Colorado bans these consensual conversations based on the viewpoints they express. 
Its content- and viewpoint-based Counseling Restriction prohibits counseling 
conversations with minors that might encourage them to change their "sexual orientation 
or gender identity, including efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions," while 
allowing conversations that provide "[a]cceptance, support, and understanding for ... 
identity exploration and development, including ... [a]ssistance to a person undergoing 
gender transition." Colo. Rev. Stat. § 12- 245-202(3.5).
The Tenth Circuit upheld this ban as a regulation of Chiles's conduct, not speech. 
In doing so, the court deepened a circuit split between the Eleventh and Third Circuits, 
which do not treat counseling conversations as conduct, and the Ninth Circuit, which 
does.
The question presented is:
Whether a law that censors certain conversations between counselors and their 
clients based on the viewpoints expressed regulates conduct or violates the Free 
Speech Clause

24-440 BERK V. CHOY
DECISION BELOW: 2024 WL 5354482
CERT. GRANTED 3/10/2025
QUESTION PRESENTED:
This case presents a clear, recognized, entrenched conflict over an important 
question about the application of state procedural rules in federal court.
Delaware, like numerous states, requires that in certain actions the plaintiff must 
also file an affidavit of merit ("AOM") with the complaint. 
See
 18 Del. C. § 6853. An 
AOM is an affidavit signed by an expert stating that there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that each defendant has committed the alleged misconduct. 
See id.
§ 6853(a)(l).
The Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth circuits hold that AOM 
provisions and comparable statutes do not govern actions in federal court because they 
answer the same question as-and therefore conflict with-several different Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure. The Third and Tenth circuits, in contrast, hold that they present "no 
conflict" with any Federal Rules.
In the decision below, the Third Circuit, in an unpublished opinion, for at least the 
fifth time, refused to hold that an AOM statute conflicts with any Federal Rules. Judge 
Phipps "concur[red] in only the judgment." Third Circuit precedent required him to vote 
to affirm, he explained, but ''writing on a clean slate ... he may not [have] arrive[d] at that 
same conclusion."
The question presented is:
Whether a state law providing that a complaint must be dismissed unless it is 
accompanied by an expert affidavit may be applied in federal court.
