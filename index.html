<p>My name is Brad and I am a second year law student at George Washington University. I wrote this podcast's data scraper and XML feed from scratch in python. All errors are my own.

I had no intention of making a website for this podcast but some of the podcasting platforms demand it.

This podcast costs me zero dollars per month to host.
If you would like to support me in spite of that information, here are some methods:
