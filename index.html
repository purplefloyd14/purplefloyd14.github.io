<p>My name is Brad and I am a second year law student at George Washington University. I wrote this podcast's data scraper and XML feed from scratch in python. All errors are my own.

I had no intention of making a website for this podcast but some of the podcasting platforms demand it.

This podcast costs me zero dollars per month to host.
