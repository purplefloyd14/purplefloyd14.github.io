<center><h2>Welcome to the website for the Supreme Court Oral Arguments Podcast</h2>
<div width=500px >

<p>My name is Brad and I am a second year law student procrastinating at George Washington University.




I had no intention of making a website for this podcast but some of the podcasting platforms demand it.

I managed to host the entire podcast for free - it costs me zero dollars per month. 
If you would like to support me in spite of that information, here are some methods:
